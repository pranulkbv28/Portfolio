        <h3>The Fast and Furious</h3>
        <p>This was my favourite movie while growing up because it had everything a young boy needs.

        <h3>
            Ajab Prem Ki Gajab Kahani
        </h3>
        <p>
            This movie was something that had mixed reactions for me. But now that I have grown up, I kinda relate to the protagonist, i.e. Prem, and whenever I look back tothis movie, it feels good.

        <p>
            One of the main reasons this comesin my top 3 is because the cast has some well known actors and also the protagonist was a personal favourite of not only mine but many kids along the globe.
